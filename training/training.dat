(iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes
 (iv)  For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be 
  40  the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.  (c) Aggregate permitted investments in all covered funds.   (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § __.10(d)(6)(ii) of this subpart), on a historical cost basis.

For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entity™s tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of: (1) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and (2) The fair market value of the banking entity™s ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under § __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.  (e) Extension of time to divest an ownership interest.   (1)   Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension 
  42  would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.

 § __.15 Other limitations on permitted covered fund activities  (a) No transaction, class of transactions, or activity may be deemed permissible under §§ __.11 through __13 of this subpart if the transaction, class of transactions, or activity would: (1)  Involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties; (2) Result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or (3) Pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States
 (b) Definition of material conflict of interest.   (1)  For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entity™s interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section
 (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity: (i) Timely and effective disclosure
 (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or (ii) Information barriers.  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entity™s business, to prevent the conflict of interest 
  48  from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.  A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entity™s establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty
 (c) Definition of high-risk asset and high-risk trading strategy.  For purposes of this section: (1) High-risk asset means an asset or group of related assets that would, if held by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States
 (2) High-risk trading strategy means a trading strategy that would, if engaged in by a banking entity, significantly increase the likelihood that the banking entity would incur a substantial financial loss or would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States

  53  Appendix A:  Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities I. Purpose This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B (\ufb01proprietary trading restrictions\ufb02).  Pursuant to § __.20(d), this appendix generally applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities.  These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to [Agency] regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports
  The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity™s internal compliance program under § __.20 and Appendix B. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and [Agency] in: (i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity™s covered trading activities; (ii) Monitoring the banking entity™s covered trading activities;   (iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions; (iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § __.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities; (v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to §§ __.4, __.5, or __.6(a)-(b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; (vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by [Agency] of such activities; and (vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity™s covered trading activities.   The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in §__.20 of the final rule.  The Agencies will review the data collected and 
  54  revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.   In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § __.20 and Appendix B.  The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity™s businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market).  In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.   On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ __.4 through __.6(a)-(b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies,  must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to [Agency], and remediation, where appropriate.  The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.   II. Definitions The terms used in this appendix have the same meanings as set forth in §§ __.2 and __.3.  In addition, for purposes of this appendix, the following definitions apply: Covered trading activity means trading conducted by a trading desk under §§ __.4, __.5, __.6(a), or __.6(b).  A banking entity may include trading under §§ __.3(d), __.6(c), __.6(d) or __.6(e).     Trading desk means the smallest discrete unit of organization of a banking entity that purchases or sells financial instruments for the trading account of the banking entity or an affiliate thereof
 Calculation period means the period of time for which a particular quantitative measurement must be calculated
 Measurement frequency means the frequency with which a particular quantitative metric must be calculated and recorded
 Comprehensive profit and loss means the net profit or loss of a trading desk™s material sources of trading revenue over a specific period of time, including, for example, any increase or 
  55  decrease in the market value of a trading desk™s holdings, dividend income, and interest income and expense
 III. Reporting and Recordkeeping of Quantitative Measurements A. Scope of Required Reporting  General scope.  Each banking entity made subject to this part by §__.20 must furnish the following quantitative measurements for each trading desk of the banking entity, calculated in accordance with this appendix:  Risk and Position Limits and Usage;  Risk Factor Sensitivities;   Value-at-Risk and Stress VaR;   Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution;   Inventory Turnover;   Inventory Aging; and  Customer-Facing Trade Ratio  B. Frequency of Required Calculation and Reporting A banking entity must calculate any applicable quantitative measurement for each trading day.  A banking entity must report each applicable quantitative measurement to [Agency] on the reporting schedule established in §__.20 unless otherwise requested by [Agency].  All quantitative measurements for any calendar month must be reported within the time period required by §__.20
 C. Recordkeeping A banking entity must, for any quantitative measurement furnished to [Agency] pursuant to this appendix and § __.20(d), create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports, as well as such information as is necessary to permit [Agency] to verify the accuracy of such reports, for a period of 5 years from the end of the calendar year for which the measurement was taken. IV
 Quantitative Measurements A. Risk-Management Measurements 1. Risk and Position Limits and Usage  56  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Risk and Position Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk.
   Usage represents the portion of the trading desk™s limits that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk.  Risk and position limits and their usage are key risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited, to the limits set out in § __.4 and § __.5.  A number of the metrics that are described below, including \ufb01Risk Factor Sensitivities\ufb02 and \ufb01Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk,\ufb02 relate to a trading desk™s risk and position limits and are useful in evaluating  and setting these limits in the broader context of the trading desk™s overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § __.4(b) and hedging activity under § __.5.  Accordingly, the limits required under § __.4(b)(2)(iii) and § __.5(b)(1)(i)  must meet the applicable requirements under § __.4(b)(2)(iii) and § __.5(b)(1)(i) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, the \ufb01Risk Factor Sensitivities\ufb02 and \ufb01Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk\ufb02 metrics except to the extent any of the \ufb01Risk Factor Sensitivities\ufb02 or \ufb01Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk\ufb02 metrics are demonstrably ineffective  for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.  General Calculation Guidance:  Risk and Position Limits must be reported in the format used by the banking entity for the purposes of risk management of each trading desk.  Risk and Position Limits are often expressed in terms of risk measures, such as VaR and Risk Factor Sensitivities, but may also be expressed in terms of other observable criteria, such as net open positions.  When criteria other than VaR or Risk Factor Sensitivities are used to define the Risk and Position Limits, both the value of the Risk and Position Limits and the value of the variables used to assess whether these limits have been reached must be reported.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily
  2.  Risk Factor Sensitivities Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Risk Factor Sensitivities are changes in a trading desk™s Comprehensive Profit and Loss that are expected to occur in the event of a change in one or more underlying variables that are significant sources of the trading desk™s profitability and risk.  General Calculation Guidance:  A banking entity must report the Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk™s overall risk management policy.  The underlying data and methods used to compute a trading desk™s Risk Factor Sensitivities will depend on the specific function of the trading desk and the internal risk management models employed.  The number and type of Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed by a trading desk, and furnished to [Agency], will depend on the explicit risks assumed by the trading desk.  In general, however, reported Risk Factor Sensitivities must be sufficiently 
  57  granular to account for a preponderance of the expected price variation in the trading desk™s holdings.   Trading desks must take into account any relevant factors in calculating Risk Factor Sensitivities, including, for example, the following with respect to particular asset classes:  Commodity derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to the related commodities set out in 17 CFR §20.2, the maturity of the positions, volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Credit positions:  risk factors with respect to credit spreads that are sufficiently granular to account for specific credit sectors and market segments, the maturity profile of the positions, and risk factors with respect to interest rates of all relevant maturities;  Credit-related derivative positions:  risk factor sensitivities, for example credit spreads,   shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in credit spreads -- volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Equity positions:  risk factors for equity prices and risk factors that differentiate between important equity market sectors and segments, such as a small capitalization equities and international equities;  Equity derivative positions:  risk factor sensitivities  such as equity positions, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Foreign exchange derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to major currency pairs and maturities,  exposure to interest rates at relevant maturities, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), as well as the maturity profile of the positions; and  Interest rate positions, including interest rate derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to major interest rate categories and maturities and volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in the interest rate curve, as well as the maturity profile of the positions.   The methods used by a banking entity to calculate sensitivities to a common factor shared by multiple trading desks, such as an equity price factor, must be applied consistently across its trading desks so that the sensitivities can be compared from one trading desk to another.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily
  58  3. Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Value-at-Risk (\ufb01VaR\ufb02) is the commonly used percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on current market conditions.  For purposes of this appendix, Stress Value-at-Risk (\ufb01Stress VaR\ufb02) is the percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on market conditions during a period of significant financial stress.   General Calculation Guidance:  Banking entities must compute and report VaR and Stress VaR by employing generally accepted standards and methods of calculation.  VaR should reflect a loss in a trading desk that is expected to be exceeded less than one percent of the time over a one-day period.  For those banking entities that are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by a Federal banking agency, VaR and Stress VaR must be computed and reported in a manner that is consistent with such regulatory capital requirements.  In cases where a trading desk does not have a standalone VaR or Stress VaR calculation but is part of a larger aggregation of positions for which a VaR or Stress VaR calculation is performed, a VaR or Stress VaR calculation that includes only the trading desk™s holdings must be performed consistent with the VaR or Stress VaR model and methodology used for the larger aggregation of positions.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily
  B. Source-of-Revenue Measurements   4. Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk™s positions to various sources.  First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into three categories: (i) profit and loss attributable to a trading desk™s existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (\ufb01existing positions\ufb02); (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day™s trading activity (\ufb01new positions\ufb02); and (iii) residual profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to existing positions or new positions.  The sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) must equal the trading desk™s comprehensive profit and loss at each point in time.  In addition, profit and loss measurements must calculate volatility of comprehensive profit and loss (i.e., the standard deviation of the trading desk™s one-day profit and loss, in dollar terms) for the reporting period for at least a 30-, 60- and 90-day lag period, from the end of the reporting period, and any other period that the banking entity deems necessary to meet the requirements of the rule
  The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day.  The comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to changes in (i) the specific Risk Factors and 
  59  other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk™s overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.    The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day.  New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions.  The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.    The portion of comprehensive profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to known sources must be allocated to a residual category identified as an unexplained portion of the comprehensive profit and loss.  Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis
  General Calculation Guidance:  The specific categories used by a trading desk in the attribution analysis and amount of detail for the analysis should be tailored to the type and amount of trading activities undertaken by the trading desk.  The new position attribution must be computed by calculating the difference between the prices at which instruments were bought and/or sold and the prices at which those instruments are marked to market at the close of business on that day multiplied by the notional or principal amount of each purchase or sale.  Any fees, commissions, or other payments received (paid) that are associated with transactions executed on that day must be added (subtracted) from such difference. These factors must be measured consistently over time to facilitate historical comparisons
    Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily.  C. Customer-Facing Activity Measurements 5. Inventory Turnover Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Turnover is a ratio that measures the turnover of a trading desk™s inventory.  The numerator of the ratio is the absolute value of all transactions over the reporting period.  The denominator of the ratio is the value of the trading desk™s inventory at the beginning of the reporting period.   General Calculation Guidance:  For purposes of this appendix, for derivatives, other than options and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.   Calculation Period: 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days. 
  6. Inventory Aging Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Aging generally describes a schedule of the trading desk™s aggregate assets and liabilities and the amount of time that those assets and liabilities have been held.  Inventory Aging should measure the age profile of the trading desk™s assets and liabilities
   General Calculation Guidance:  In general, Inventory Aging must be computed using a trading desk™s trading activity data and must identify the value of a trading desk™s aggregate assets and liabilities.  Inventory Aging must include two schedules, an asset-aging schedule and a liability-aging schedule
  Each schedule must record the value of assets or liabilities held over all holding periods.  For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value and, for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily
  7. Customer-Facing Trade Ratio Œ Trade Count Based and Value Based Description:  For purposes of this appendix, the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio is a ratio comparing (i) the transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk to (ii) the transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.  A trade count based ratio must be computed that records the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.  A value based ratio must be computed that records the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.   General Calculation Guidance: For purposes of calculating the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio, a counterparty is considered to be a customer of the trading desk if the counterparty is a market participant that makes use of the banking entity™s market making-related services by obtaining such services, responding to quotations, or entering into a continuing relationship with respect to such services.  However, a trading desk or other organizational unit of another banking entity would not be a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk if the other entity has trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more as measured in accordance with §__.20(d)(1) unless the trading desk documents how and why a particular trading desk or other organizational unit of the entity should be treated as a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk.  Transactions conducted anonymously on an exchange or similar trading facility that permits trading on behalf of a broad range of market participants would be considered transactions with 
  61  customers of the trading desk.  For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value
Enhanced Minimum Standards for Compliance Programs   I. Overview   Section __.20(c) requires certain banking entities to establish, maintain, and enforce an enhanced compliance program that includes the requirements and standards in this Appendix as well as the minimum written policies and procedures, internal controls, management framework, independent testing, training, and recordkeeping provisions outlined in § __.20.  This Appendix sets forth additional minimum standards with respect to the establishment, oversight, maintenance, and enforcement by these banking entities of an enhanced internal compliance program for ensuring and monitoring compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments set forth in section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.   This compliance program must:   Be reasonably designed to identify, document, monitor, and report the permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments of the banking entity; identify, monitor and promptly address the risks of these covered activities and investments and potential areas of noncompliance; and prevent activities or investments prohibited by, or that do not comply with, section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;    Establish and enforce appropriate limits on the covered activities and investments of the banking entity, including limits on the size, scope, complexity, and risks of the individual activities or investments consistent with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;    Subject the effectiveness of the compliance program to periodic independent review and testing, and ensure that the entity™s internal audit, corporate compliance and internal control functions involved in review and testing are effective and independent;   Make senior management, and others as appropriate, accountable for the effective implementation of the compliance program, and ensure that the board of directors and chief executive officer (or equivalent) of the banking entity review the effectiveness of the compliance program; and   Facilitate supervision and examination by the Agencies of the banking entity™s permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments.   II. Enhanced Compliance Program  A. Proprietary Trading Activities  A banking entity must establish, maintain and enforce a compliance program that includes written policies and procedures that are appropriate for the types, size, and complexity 
  63  of, and risks associated with, its permitted trading activities.  The compliance program may be tailored to the types of trading activities conducted by the banking entity, and must include a detailed description of controls established by the banking entity to reasonably ensure that its trading activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements and limitations applicable to those trading activities under section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and provide for appropriate revision of the compliance program before expansion of the trading activities of the banking entity.  A banking entity must devote adequate resources and use knowledgeable personnel in conducting, supervising and managing its trading activities, and promote consistency, independence and rigor in implementing its risk controls and compliance efforts.  The compliance program must be updated with a frequency sufficient to account for changes in the activities of the banking entity, results of independent testing of the program, identification of weaknesses in the program, and changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements
   Trading Desks: The banking entity must have written policies and procedures governing each trading desk that include a description of:  The process for identifying, authorizing and documenting financial instruments each trading desk may purchase or sell, with separate documentation for market making-related activities conducted in reliance on § __.4(b) and for hedging activity conducted in reliance on § __.5;  A mapping for each trading desk to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that is responsible for managing and overseeing the trading desk™s activities;  The mission (i.e

Risk assessments must take into account both the risks inherent in the trading activity and the strength and effectiveness of controls designed to mitigate those risks;  How the risks allocated to each trading desk will be measured;   Why the allocated risks levels are appropriate to the activities authorized for the trading desk;   The limits on the holding period of, and the risk associated with, financial instruments under the responsibility of the trading desk;  The process for setting new or revised limits, as well as escalation procedures for granting exceptions to any limits or to any policies or procedures governing the desk, the analysis that will be required to support revising limits or granting exceptions, and the process for independently reviewing and documenting those exceptions and the underlying analysis;  The process for identifying, documenting and approving new products, trading strategies, and hedging strategies; 
  64   The types of clients, customers, and counterparties with whom the trading desk may trade; and  The compensation arrangements, including incentive arrangements, for employees associated with the trading desk, which may not be designed to reward or incentivize prohibited proprietary trading or excessive or imprudent risk-taking
 Description of risks and risk management processes: The compliance program for the banking entity must include a comprehensive description of the risk management program for the trading activity of the banking entity.  The compliance program must also include a description of the governance, approval, reporting, escalation, review and other processes the banking entity will use to reasonably ensure that trading activity is conducted in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  Trading activity in similar financial instruments should be subject to similar governance, limits, testing, controls, and review, unless the banking entity specifically determines to establish different limits or processes and documents those differences.  Descriptions must include, at a minimum, the following elements:  A description of the supervisory and risk management structure governing all trading activity, including a description of processes for initial and senior-level review of new products and new strategies;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all models used for valuing, identifying and monitoring the risks of trading activity and related positions, including the process for periodic independent testing of the reliability and accuracy of those models;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing the limits established for each trading desk;   A description of the process by which a security may be purchased or sold pursuant to the liquidity management plan, including the process for authorizing and monitoring such activity to ensure compliance with the banking entity™s liquidity management plan and the restrictions on liquidity management activities in this part;  A description of the management review process, including escalation procedures, for approving any temporary exceptions or permanent adjustments to limits on the activities, positions, strategies, or risks associated with each trading desk; and  The role of the audit, compliance, risk management and other relevant units for conducting independent testing of trading and hedging activities, techniques and strategies. Authorized risks, instruments, and products. The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entity™s written policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk.  These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (e.g
, Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions.  At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:  The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;   The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and 
  65   The types of hedging instruments used, hedging strategies employed, and the amount of risk effectively hedged.   Hedging policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures regarding the use of risk-mitigating hedging instruments and strategies that, at a minimum, describe:  The positions, techniques and strategies that each trading desk may use to hedge the risk of its positions;  The manner in which the  banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;  The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;  The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;  The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and  The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on § __.5.  Analysis and quantitative measurements. The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entity™s compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading.  Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading.  This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance.  In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A to this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks.  The banking entity™s analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:  Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;  Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;  The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and 
  66   Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desk™s activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to [Agency], appropriate remedial action (e.g
, divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part
 Other Compliance Matters. In addition to the requirements specified above, the banking entity™s compliance program must:  Identify activities of each trading desk that will be conducted in reliance on exemptions contained in §§ __
4 through __.6, including an explanation of: o How and where in the organization the activity occurs; and o Which exemption is being relied on and how the activity meets the specific requirements for reliance on the applicable exemption;  Include an explanation of the process for documenting, approving and reviewing actions taken pursuant to the liquidity management plan, where in the organization this activity occurs, the securities permissible for liquidity management, the process for ensuring that liquidity management activities are not conducted for the purpose of prohibited proprietary trading, and the process for ensuring that securities purchased as part of the liquidity management plan are highly liquid and conform to the requirements of this part;   Describe how the banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by each trading desk that relies on the exemptions contained in §§ __.3(d)(3), and __.4 through __.6 , which must take into account potential or actual exposure to: o Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated; o Assets whose changes in value cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging; o New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history; o Assets or strategies that include significant embedded leverage; o Assets or strategies that have demonstrated significant historical volatility; o Assets or strategies for which the application of capital and liquidity standards would not adequately account for the risk; and o Assets or strategies that result in large and significant concentrations to sectors, risk factors, or counterparties;    Establish responsibility for compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of subpart B and § __.20; and  Establish policies for monitoring and prohibiting potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties.

The board of directors or similar corporate body must also ensure that senior management has established appropriate incentives and adequate resources to support compliance with this part, including the implementation of a compliance program meeting the requirements of this appendix into management goals and compensation structures across the banking entity
    Senior management. Senior management is responsible for implementing and enforcing the approved compliance program.  Senior management must also ensure that effective corrective action is taken when failures in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part are identified.  Senior management and control personnel charged with overseeing compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part should review the compliance program for the banking entity periodically and report to the board, or an appropriate committee thereof, on the effectiveness of the compliance program and compliance matters with a frequency appropriate to the size, scope, and risk profile of the banking entity™s trading activities and covered fund activities or investments, which shall be at least annually.  CEO attestation.  Based on a review by the CEO of the banking entity, the CEO of the banking entity must, annually, attest in writing to [Agency] that the banking entity has in place 
  71  processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test and modify the compliance program established under this Appendix and § __.20 of this part in a manner reasonably designed to achieve compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  In the case of a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign banking entity, the attestation may be provided for the entire U.S. operations of the foreign banking entity by the senior management officer of the United States operations of the foreign banking entity who is located in the United States
  IV. Independent Testing  Independent testing must occur with a frequency appropriate to the size, scope, and risk profile of the banking entity™s trading and covered fund activities or investments, which shall be at least annually.
