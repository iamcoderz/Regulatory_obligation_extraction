12(a)(2)(ii) and  __.12(d) of this subpart; and  (3) With respect to any banking entity, the aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired and retained under  __.11 of this subpart, including all covered funds in which the banking entity holds an ownership interest in connection with underwriting and market making related activities permitted under paragraph (c) of this section, are included in the calculation of all ownership interests under  __.12(a)(2)(iii) and  __.12(d) of this subpart

  37  (1)  Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in  __.10(a) of this subpart, a banking entity may acquire and retain an ownership interest in a covered fund that the banking entity or an affiliate thereof organizes and offers pursuant to  __.11, for the purposes of: (i) Establishment.

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in any covered fund made or held pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not exceed 3 percent of the total number or value of the outstanding ownership interests of the fund

 (B) An investment by a banking entity and its affiliates in a covered fund that is an issuing entity of asset-backed securities may not exceed 3 percent of the total fair market value of the ownership interests of the fund measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(3), unless a greater percentage is retained by the banking entity and its affiliates in compliance with the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder, in which case the investment by the banking entity and its affiliates in the covered fund may not exceed the amount, number, or value of ownership interests of the fund required under section 15G of the Exchange Act and the implementing regulations issued thereunder.

The aggregate value of all ownership interests of the banking entity and its affiliates in all covered funds acquired or retained under this section may not exceed 3 percent of the tier 1 capital of the banking entity, as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter

 (ii) Treatment of registered investment companies, SEC-regulated business development companies and foreign public funds.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a registered investment company, SEC-regulated business development companies or foreign public fund as described in __.10(c)(1) of this subpart will not be considered to be an affiliate of the banking entity so long as the banking entity: (A) Does not own, control, or hold with the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting shares of the company or fund; and  (B) Provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, administrative, and other services to the company or fund in compliance with the limitations under applicable regulation, order, or other authority

 (iii) Covered funds.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a covered fund will not be considered to be an affiliate of a banking entity so long as the covered fund is held in compliance with the requirements of this subpart

 (iv) Treatment of employee and director investments financed by the banking entity.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires an ownership interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the ownership interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund

  (2)  Calculation of permitted ownership interests in a single covered fund.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4), for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:  

  39  (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment); (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment).  If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;  (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii), once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

  (3)      Issuing entities of asset-backed securities.  In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section: (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or  (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.  (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes

 (iv)  For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be 

  40  the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

 (4) Multi-tier fund investments. (i) Master-feeder fund investments. If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the feeder fund) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the master fund), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entitys permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund.  The banking entitys permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and (ii) Fund-of-funds investments.  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to __.11 of this subpart for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a fund of funds) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entitys permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the fund that is held through the fund of funds.  The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.  (c) Aggregate permitted investments in all covered funds.   (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of this subpart), on a historical cost basis.   (2) Calculation of tier 1 capital. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:  (i) Entities that are required to hold and report tier 1 capital.  If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:  (A)   In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;  

  41  (B)  In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:  (1) Bank holding company subsidiaries.  If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and (2) Other holding companies and any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards

 (iii) Treatment of foreign banking entities.    (A) Foreign banking entities.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards

 (B) U.S. affiliates of foreign banking entities.  With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  (d) Capital treatment for a permitted investment in a covered fund.  For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entitys tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of: (1) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and (2) The fair market value of the banking entitys ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.  (e) Extension of time to divest an ownership interest.   (1)   Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension 

  42  would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.  An application for extension must: (i) Be submitted to the Board at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period; (ii) Provide the reasons for application, including information that addresses the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and (iii) Explain the banking entitys plan for reducing the permitted investment in a covered fund through redemption, sale, dilution or other methods as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section

 (2) Factors governing Board determinations.  In reviewing any application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Board may consider all the facts and circumstances related to the permitted investment in a covered fund, including: (i) Whether the investment would result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; (ii) The contractual terms governing the banking entitys interest in the covered fund; (iii) The date on which the covered fund is expected to have attracted sufficient investments from investors unaffiliated with the banking entity to enable the banking entity to comply with the limitations in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; (iv) The total exposure of the covered banking entity to the investment and the risks that disposing of, or maintaining, the investment in the covered fund may pose to the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States; (v) The cost to the banking entity of divesting or disposing of the investment within the applicable period; (vi) Whether the investment or the divestiture or conformance of the investment would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and unaffiliated parties, including clients, customers or counterparties to which it owes a duty;  (vi) The banking entitys prior efforts to reduce through redemption, sale, dilution, or other methods its ownership interests in the covered fund, including activities related to the marketing of interests in such covered fund;  (viii) Market conditions; and (ix) Any other factor that the Board believes appropriate.  (3) Authority to impose restrictions on activities or investment during any extension period.  The Board may impose such conditions on any extension approved under paragraph (e)(1) of this section as the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to protect the safety 

  43  and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States, address material conflicts of interest or other unsound banking practices, or otherwise further the purposes of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part

 (4) Consultation.  In the case of a banking entity that is primarily regulated by another Federal banking agency, the SEC, or the CFTC, the Board will consult with such agency prior to acting on an application by the banking entity for an extension under paragraph (e)(1) of this section

  The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entitys internal compliance program under  __.20 and Appendix B. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and [Agency] in: (i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entitys covered trading activities; (ii) Monitoring the banking entitys covered trading activities;   (iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions; (iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to  __.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities; (v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to  __.4, __.5, or __.6(a)-(b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; (vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by [Agency] of such activities; and (vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entitys covered trading activities.   The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in __.20 of the final rule.  The Agencies will review the data collected and 

  56  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Risk and Position Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk.  Usage represents the portion of the trading desks limits that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk.  Risk and position limits and their usage are key risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited, to the limits set out in  __.4 and  __.5.  A number of the metrics that are described below, including Risk Factor Sensitivities and Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk, relate to a trading desks risk and position limits and are useful in evaluating  and setting these limits in the broader context of the trading desks overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under  __.4(b) and hedging activity under  __.5.  Accordingly, the limits required under  __.4(b)(2)(iii) and  __.5(b)(1)(i)  must meet the applicable requirements under  __.4(b)(2)(iii) and  __.5(b)(1)(i) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, the Risk Factor Sensitivities and Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk metrics except to the extent any of the Risk Factor Sensitivities or Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk metrics are demonstrably ineffective  for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.  General Calculation Guidance:  Risk and Position Limits must be reported in the format used by the banking entity for the purposes of risk management of each trading desk.  Risk and Position Limits are often expressed in terms of risk measures, such as VaR and Risk Factor Sensitivities, but may also be expressed in terms of other observable criteria, such as net open positions.  When criteria other than VaR or Risk Factor Sensitivities are used to define the Risk and Position Limits, both the value of the Risk and Position Limits and the value of the variables used to assess whether these limits have been reached must be reported.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily

  2.  Risk Factor Sensitivities Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Risk Factor Sensitivities are changes in a trading desks Comprehensive Profit and Loss that are expected to occur in the event of a change in one or more underlying variables that are significant sources of the trading desks profitability and risk.  General Calculation Guidance:  A banking entity must report the Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desks overall risk management policy.  The underlying data and methods used to compute a trading desks Risk Factor Sensitivities will depend on the specific function of the trading desk and the internal risk management models employed.  The number and type of Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed by a trading desk, and furnished to [Agency], will depend on the explicit risks assumed by the trading desk.  In general, however, reported Risk Factor Sensitivities must be sufficiently 

  57  granular to account for a preponderance of the expected price variation in the trading desks holdings.   Trading desks must take into account any relevant factors in calculating Risk Factor Sensitivities, including, for example, the following with respect to particular asset classes:  Commodity derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to the related commodities set out in 17 CFR 20.2, the maturity of the positions, volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Credit positions:  risk factors with respect to credit spreads that are sufficiently granular to account for specific credit sectors and market segments, the maturity profile of the positions, and risk factors with respect to interest rates of all relevant maturities;  Credit-related derivative positions:  risk factor sensitivities, for example credit spreads,   shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in credit spreads -- volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Equity positions:  risk factors for equity prices and risk factors that differentiate between important equity market sectors and segments, such as a small capitalization equities and international equities;  Equity derivative positions:  risk factor sensitivities  such as equity positions, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;  Foreign exchange derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to major currency pairs and maturities,  exposure to interest rates at relevant maturities, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), as well as the maturity profile of the positions; and  Interest rate positions, including interest rate derivative positions:  risk factors with respect to major interest rate categories and maturities and volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in the interest rate curve, as well as the maturity profile of the positions.   The methods used by a banking entity to calculate sensitivities to a common factor shared by multiple trading desks, such as an equity price factor, must be applied consistently across its trading desks so that the sensitivities can be compared from one trading desk to another.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily

  B. Source-of-Revenue Measurements   4. Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desks positions to various sources.  First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into three categories: (i) profit and loss attributable to a trading desks existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (existing positions); (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current days trading activity (new positions); and (iii) residual profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to existing positions or new positions.  The sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) must equal the trading desks comprehensive profit and loss at each point in time.  In addition, profit and loss measurements must calculate volatility of comprehensive profit and loss (i.e., the standard deviation of the trading desks one-day profit and loss, in dollar terms) for the reporting period for at least a 30-, 60- and 90-day lag period, from the end of the reporting period, and any other period that the banking entity deems necessary to meet the requirements of the rule

  The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day.  The comprehensive profit and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to changes in (i) the specific Risk Factors and 

  59  other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desks overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.    The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day.  New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions.  The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.    The portion of comprehensive profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to known sources must be allocated to a residual category identified as an unexplained portion of the comprehensive profit and loss.  Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis

  General Calculation Guidance:  The specific categories used by a trading desk in the attribution analysis and amount of detail for the analysis should be tailored to the type and amount of trading activities undertaken by the trading desk.  The new position attribution must be computed by calculating the difference between the prices at which instruments were bought and/or sold and the prices at which those instruments are marked to market at the close of business on that day multiplied by the notional or principal amount of each purchase or sale.  Any fees, commissions, or other payments received (paid) that are associated with transactions executed on that day must be added (subtracted) from such difference. These factors must be measured consistently over time to facilitate historical comparisons

    Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily.  C. Customer-Facing Activity Measurements 5. Inventory Turnover Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Turnover is a ratio that measures the turnover of a trading desks inventory.  The numerator of the ratio is the absolute value of all transactions over the reporting period.  The denominator of the ratio is the value of the trading desks inventory at the beginning of the reporting period.   General Calculation Guidance:  For purposes of this appendix, for derivatives, other than options and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.   Calculation Period: 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days. 

  6. Inventory Aging Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Inventory Aging generally describes a schedule of the trading desks aggregate assets and liabilities and the amount of time that those assets and liabilities have been held.  Inventory Aging should measure the age profile of the trading desks assets and liabilities

   General Calculation Guidance:  In general, Inventory Aging must be computed using a trading desks trading activity data and must identify the value of a trading desks aggregate assets and liabilities.  Inventory Aging must include two schedules, an asset-aging schedule and a liability-aging schedule

  Each schedule must record the value of assets or liabilities held over all holding periods.  For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value and, for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily

  7. Customer-Facing Trade Ratio  Trade Count Based and Value Based Description:  For purposes of this appendix, the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio is a ratio comparing (i) the transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk to (ii) the transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.  A trade count based ratio must be computed that records the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.  A value based ratio must be computed that records the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.   General Calculation Guidance: For purposes of calculating the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio, a counterparty is considered to be a customer of the trading desk if the counterparty is a market participant that makes use of the banking entitys market making-related services by obtaining such services, responding to quotations, or entering into a continuing relationship with respect to such services.  However, a trading desk or other organizational unit of another banking entity would not be a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk if the other entity has trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more as measured in accordance with __.20(d)(1) unless the trading desk documents how and why a particular trading desk or other organizational unit of the entity should be treated as a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk.  Transactions conducted anonymously on an exchange or similar trading facility that permits trading on behalf of a broad range of market participants would be considered transactions with 

  61  customers of the trading desk.  For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value

 Calculation Period: 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days

  63  of, and risks associated with, its permitted trading activities.  The compliance program may be tailored to the types of trading activities conducted by the banking entity, and must include a detailed description of controls established by the banking entity to reasonably ensure that its trading activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements and limitations applicable to those trading activities under section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, and provide for appropriate revision of the compliance program before expansion of the trading activities of the banking entity.  A banking entity must devote adequate resources and use knowledgeable personnel in conducting, supervising and managing its trading activities, and promote consistency, independence and rigor in implementing its risk controls and compliance efforts.  The compliance program must be updated with a frequency sufficient to account for changes in the activities of the banking entity, results of independent testing of the program, identification of weaknesses in the program, and changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements

   Trading Desks: The banking entity must have written policies and procedures governing each trading desk that include a description of:  The process for identifying, authorizing and documenting financial instruments each trading desk may purchase or sell, with separate documentation for market making-related activities conducted in reliance on  __.4(b) and for hedging activity conducted in reliance on  __.5;  A mapping for each trading desk to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that is responsible for managing and overseeing the trading desks activities;  The mission (i.e

Risk assessments must take into account both the risks inherent in the trading activity and the strength and effectiveness of controls designed to mitigate those risks;  How the risks allocated to each trading desk will be measured;   Why the allocated risks levels are appropriate to the activities authorized for the trading desk;   The limits on the holding period of, and the risk associated with, financial instruments under the responsibility of the trading desk;  The process for setting new or revised limits, as well as escalation procedures for granting exceptions to any limits or to any policies or procedures governing the desk, the analysis that will be required to support revising limits or granting exceptions, and the process for independently reviewing and documenting those exceptions and the underlying analysis;  The process for identifying, documenting and approving new products, trading strategies, and hedging strategies; 

  64   The types of clients, customers, and counterparties with whom the trading desk may trade; and  The compensation arrangements, including incentive arrangements, for employees associated with the trading desk, which may not be designed to reward or incentivize prohibited proprietary trading or excessive or imprudent risk-taking

 Description of risks and risk management processes: The compliance program for the banking entity must include a comprehensive description of the risk management program for the trading activity of the banking entity.  The compliance program must also include a description of the governance, approval, reporting, escalation, review and other processes the banking entity will use to reasonably ensure that trading activity is conducted in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  Trading activity in similar financial instruments should be subject to similar governance, limits, testing, controls, and review, unless the banking entity specifically determines to establish different limits or processes and documents those differences.  Descriptions must include, at a minimum, the following elements:  A description of the supervisory and risk management structure governing all trading activity, including a description of processes for initial and senior-level review of new products and new strategies;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all models used for valuing, identifying and monitoring the risks of trading activity and related positions, including the process for periodic independent testing of the reliability and accuracy of those models;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing the limits established for each trading desk;   A description of the process by which a security may be purchased or sold pursuant to the liquidity management plan, including the process for authorizing and monitoring such activity to ensure compliance with the banking entitys liquidity management plan and the restrictions on liquidity management activities in this part;  A description of the management review process, including escalation procedures, for approving any temporary exceptions or permanent adjustments to limits on the activities, positions, strategies, or risks associated with each trading desk; and  The role of the audit, compliance, risk management and other relevant units for conducting independent testing of trading and hedging activities, techniques and strategies. Authorized risks, instruments, and products. The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entitys written policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk.  These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (e.g

, Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions.  At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:  The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;   The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and 

  65   The types of hedging instruments used, hedging strategies employed, and the amount of risk effectively hedged.   Hedging policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures regarding the use of risk-mitigating hedging instruments and strategies that, at a minimum, describe:  The positions, techniques and strategies that each trading desk may use to hedge the risk of its positions;  The manner in which the  banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;  The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;  The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;  The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and  The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on  __.5.  Analysis and quantitative measurements. The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entitys compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading.  Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading.  This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance.  In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A to this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks.  The banking entitys analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:  Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;  Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;  The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and 

  66   Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desks activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to [Agency], appropriate remedial action (e.g

, divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part
