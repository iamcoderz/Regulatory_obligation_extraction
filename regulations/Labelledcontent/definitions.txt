 (b) Definition of material conflict of interest.   (1)  For purposes of this section, a material conflict of interest between a banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties exists if the banking entity engages in any transaction, class of transactions, or activity that would involve or result in the banking entitys interests being materially adverse to the interests of its client, customer, or counterparty with respect to such transaction, class of transactions, or activity, and the banking entity has not taken at least one of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section

 (2) Prior to effecting the specific transaction or class or type of transactions, or engaging in the specific activity, the banking entity: (i) Timely and effective disclosure

 (A) Has made clear, timely, and effective disclosure of the conflict of interest, together with other necessary information, in reasonable detail and in a manner sufficient to permit a reasonable client, customer, or counterparty to meaningfully understand the conflict of interest; and (B) Such disclosure is made in a manner that provides the client, customer, or counterparty the opportunity to negate, or substantially mitigate, any materially adverse effect on the client, customer, or counterparty created by the conflict of interest; or (ii) Information barriers.  Has established, maintained, and enforced information barriers that are memorialized in written policies and procedures, such as physical separation of personnel, or functions, or limitations on types of activity, that are reasonably designed, taking into consideration the nature of the banking entitys business, to prevent the conflict of interest 

  48  from involving or resulting in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty.  A banking entity may not rely on such information barriers if, in the case of any specific transaction, class or type of transactions or activity, the banking entity knows or should reasonably know that, notwithstanding the banking entitys establishment of information barriers, the conflict of interest may involve or result in a materially adverse effect on a client, customer, or counterparty

  58  3. Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk  Description:  For purposes of this appendix, Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the commonly used percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on current market conditions.  For purposes of this appendix, Stress Value-at-Risk (Stress VaR) is the percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on market conditions during a period of significant financial stress.   General Calculation Guidance:  Banking entities must compute and report VaR and Stress VaR by employing generally accepted standards and methods of calculation.  VaR should reflect a loss in a trading desk that is expected to be exceeded less than one percent of the time over a one-day period.  For those banking entities that are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by a Federal banking agency, VaR and Stress VaR must be computed and reported in a manner that is consistent with such regulatory capital requirements.  In cases where a trading desk does not have a standalone VaR or Stress VaR calculation but is part of a larger aggregation of positions for which a VaR or Stress VaR calculation is performed, a VaR or Stress VaR calculation that includes only the trading desks holdings must be performed consistent with the VaR or Stress VaR model and methodology used for the larger aggregation of positions.   Calculation Period: One trading day. Measurement Frequency: Daily
