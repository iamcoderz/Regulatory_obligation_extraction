  53  Appendix A:  Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities I. Purpose This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B (proprietary trading restrictions).  Pursuant to  __.20(d), this appendix generally applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities.  These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to [Agency] regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports

  54  revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.   In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by  __.20 and Appendix B.  The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entitys businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market).  In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.   On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under  __.4 through __.6(a)-(b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies,  must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to [Agency], and remediation, where appropriate.  The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.   II. Definitions The terms used in this appendix have the same meanings as set forth in  __.2 and __.3.  In addition, for purposes of this appendix, the following definitions apply: Covered trading activity means trading conducted by a trading desk under  __.4, __.5, __.6(a), or __.6(b).  A banking entity may include trading under  __.3(d), __.6(c), __.6(d) or __.6(e).     Trading desk means the smallest discrete unit of organization of a banking entity that purchases or sells financial instruments for the trading account of the banking entity or an affiliate thereof

 III. Reporting and Recordkeeping of Quantitative Measurements A. Scope of Required Reporting  General scope.  Each banking entity made subject to this part by __.20 must furnish the following quantitative measurements for each trading desk of the banking entity, calculated in accordance with this appendix:  Risk and Position Limits and Usage;  Risk Factor Sensitivities;   Value-at-Risk and Stress VaR;   Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution;   Inventory Turnover;   Inventory Aging; and  Customer-Facing Trade Ratio  B. Frequency of Required Calculation and Reporting A banking entity must calculate any applicable quantitative measurement for each trading day.  A banking entity must report each applicable quantitative measurement to [Agency] on the reporting schedule established in __.20 unless otherwise requested by [Agency].  All quantitative measurements for any calendar month must be reported within the time period required by __.20

 C. Recordkeeping A banking entity must, for any quantitative measurement furnished to [Agency] pursuant to this appendix and  __.20(d), create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports, as well as such information as is necessary to permit [Agency] to verify the accuracy of such reports, for a period of 5 years from the end of the calendar year for which the measurement was taken.
