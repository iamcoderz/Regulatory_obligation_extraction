The compliance program must also include a description of the governance, approval, reporting, escalation, review and other processes the banking entity will use to reasonably ensure that trading activity is conducted in compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  Trading activity in similar financial instruments should be subject to similar governance, limits, testing, controls, and review, unless the banking entity specifically determines to establish different limits or processes and documents those differences.  Descriptions must include, at a minimum, the following elements:  A description of the supervisory and risk management structure governing all trading activity, including a description of processes for initial and senior-level review of new products and new strategies;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all models used for valuing, identifying and monitoring the risks of trading activity and related positions, including the process for periodic independent testing of the reliability and accuracy of those models;  A description of the process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing the limits established for each trading desk;   A description of the process by which a security may be purchased or sold pursuant to the liquidity management plan, including the process for authorizing and monitoring such activity to ensure compliance with the banking entitys liquidity management plan and the restrictions on liquidity management activities in this part;  A description of the management review process, including escalation procedures, for approving any temporary exceptions or permanent adjustments to limits on the activities, positions, strategies, or risks associated with each trading desk; and  The role of the audit, compliance, risk management and other relevant units for conducting independent testing of trading and hedging activities, techniques and strategies. Authorized risks, instruments, and products. The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entitys written policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk.  These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (e.g

, Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions.  At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:  The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;   The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and 

  65   The types of hedging instruments used, hedging strategies employed, and the amount of risk effectively hedged.   Hedging policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures regarding the use of risk-mitigating hedging instruments and strategies that, at a minimum, describe:  The positions, techniques and strategies that each trading desk may use to hedge the risk of its positions;  The manner in which the  banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;  The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;  The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;  The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and  The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on  __.5.

The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entitys compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading.  Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading.  This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance.  In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A to this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks.  The banking entitys analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:  Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;  Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;  The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and 

  66   Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desks activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to [Agency], appropriate remedial action (e.g

, divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part
