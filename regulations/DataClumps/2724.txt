A banking entity must devote adequate resources and use knowledgeable personnel in conducting, supervising and managing its trading activities, and promote consistency, independence and rigor in implementing its risk controls and compliance efforts.  The compliance program must be updated with a frequency sufficient to account for changes in the activities of the banking entity, results of independent testing of the program, identification of weaknesses in the program, and changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements

   Trading Desks: The banking entity must have written policies and procedures governing each trading desk that include a description of:  The process for identifying, authorizing and documenting financial instruments each trading desk may purchase or sell, with separate documentation for market making-related activities conducted in reliance on  __.4(b) and for hedging activity conducted in reliance on  __.5;  A mapping for each trading desk to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that is responsible for managing and overseeing the trading desks activities;  The mission (i.e

Risk assessments must take into account both the risks inherent in the trading activity and the strength and effectiveness of controls designed to mitigate those risks;  How the risks allocated to each trading desk will be measured;   Why the allocated risks levels are appropriate to the activities authorized for the trading desk;   The limits on the holding period of, and the risk associated with, financial instruments under the responsibility of the trading desk;  The process for setting new or revised limits, as well as escalation procedures for granting exceptions to any limits or to any policies or procedures governing the desk, the analysis that will be required to support revising limits or granting exceptions, and the process for independently reviewing and documenting those exceptions and the underlying analysis;  The process for identifying, documenting and approving new products, trading strategies, and hedging strategies; 

  64   The types of clients, customers, and counterparties with whom the trading desk may trade; and  The compensation arrangements, including incentive arrangements, for employees associated with the trading desk, which may not be designed to reward or incentivize prohibited proprietary trading or excessive or imprudent risk-taking

, Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions.  At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:  The financial instruments (including, at a minimum, by type and exposure) that the trading desk may trade;   The types and levels of risks that may be taken by each trading desk; and 

  65   The types of hedging instruments used, hedging strategies employed, and the amount of risk effectively hedged.   Hedging policies and procedures.  The banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures regarding the use of risk-mitigating hedging instruments and strategies that, at a minimum, describe:  The positions, techniques and strategies that each trading desk may use to hedge the risk of its positions;  The manner in which the  banking entity will identify the risks arising in connection with and related to the individual or aggregated positions, contracts or other holdings of the banking entity that are to be hedged and determine that those risks have been properly and effectively hedged;  The level of the organization at which hedging activity and management will occur;  The manner in which hedging strategies will be monitored and the personnel responsible for such monitoring;  The risk management processes used to control unhedged or residual risks; and  The process for developing, documenting, testing, approving and reviewing all hedging positions, techniques and strategies permitted for each trading desk and for the banking entity in reliance on  __.5.  Analysis and quantitative measurements. The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entitys compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading.  Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading.  This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance.  In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A to this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks.  The banking entitys analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:  Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;  Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;  The establishment of numerical thresholds and appropriate trading measures for each trading desk and heightened review of trading activity not consistent with those thresholds to ensure compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including analysis of the measurement results or other information, appropriate escalation procedures, and documentation related to the review; and 

  66   Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desks activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to [Agency], appropriate remedial action (e.g

, divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part
