  B. Covered Fund Activities or Investments  A banking entity must establish, maintain and enforce a compliance program that includes written policies and procedures that are appropriate for the types, size, complexity and risks of the covered fund and related activities conducted and investments made, by the banking entity.  Identification of covered funds. The banking entitys compliance program must provide a process, which must include appropriate management review and independent testing, for identifying and documenting covered funds that each unit within the banking entitys organization sponsors or organizes and offers, and covered funds in which each such unit invests.  In addition to the documentation requirements for covered funds, as specified under  __.20(e), the documentation must include information that identifies all pools that the banking entity sponsors or has an interest in and the type of exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act (whether or not the pool relies on section 4.7 of the regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act), and the amount of ownership interest the banking entity has in those pools

  Identification of covered fund activities and investments. The banking entitys compliance program must identify, document and map each unit within the organization that is permitted to acquire or hold an interest in any covered fund or sponsor any covered fund and map each unit to the division, business line, or other organizational structure that will be responsible for managing and overseeing that units activities and investments

     Explanation of compliance. The banking entitys compliance program must explain how:  The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties related to its covered fund activities and investments;  The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual transactions or activities that may threaten the safety and soundness of the banking entity related to its covered fund activities and investments; and  The banking entity monitors for and prohibits potential or actual material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies presented by its 

  68  covered fund activities and investments, taking into account potential or actual exposure to: o Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;  o Assets whose changes in values cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging; o New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history; o Assets or strategies that include significant embedded leverage; o Assets or strategies that have demonstrated significant historical volatility; o Assets or strategies for which the application of capital and liquidity standards would not adequately account for the risk; and o Assets or strategies that expose the banking entity to large and significant concentrations with respect to sectors, risk factors, or counterparties; Description and documentation of covered fund activities and investments.  For each organizational unit engaged in covered fund activities and investments, the banking entitys compliance program must document:  o The covered fund activities and investments that the unit is authorized to conduct;  o The banking entitys plan for actively seeking unaffiliated investors to ensure that any investment by the banking entity conforms to the limits contained in  __.12 or registered in compliance with the securities laws and thereby exempt from those limits within the time periods allotted in __.12; and o How it complies with the requirements of subpart C

 A banking entity must establish, maintain, and enforce internal controls that are reasonably designed to ensure that its covered fund activities or investments comply with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and are appropriate given the limits on risk established by the banking entity.  These written internal controls must be reasonably designed and established to effectively monitor and identify for further analysis any covered fund activity or investment that may indicate potential violations of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part

  The internal controls must, at a minimum require:  Monitoring and limiting the banking entitys individual and aggregate investments in covered funds;  Monitoring the amount and timing of seed capital investments for compliance with the limitations under subpart C (including but not limited to the redemption, sale or disposition requirements) of  __.12, and the effectiveness of efforts to seek unaffiliated investors to ensure compliance with those limits;  Calculating the individual and aggregate levels of ownership interests in one or more covered fund required by  __
