  52  (a) Any banking entity that engages in an activity or makes an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or acts in a manner that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, including through an abuse of any activity or investment permitted under subparts B or C, or otherwise violates the restrictions and requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, shall, upon discovery, promptly terminate the activity and, as relevant, dispose of the investment

 (b) Whenever [Agency] finds reasonable cause to believe any banking entity has engaged in an activity or made an investment in violation of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, or engaged in any activity or made any investment that functions as an evasion of the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part, [Agency] may take any action permitted by law to enforce compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part, including directing the banking entity to restrict, limit, or terminate any or all activities under this part and dispose of any investment

  The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entitys internal compliance program under  __.20 and Appendix B. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and [Agency] in: (i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entitys covered trading activities; (ii) Monitoring the banking entitys covered trading activities;   (iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions; (iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to  __.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities; (v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to  __.4, __.5, or __.6(a)-(b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies; (vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by [Agency] of such activities; and (vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entitys covered trading activities.   The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are not intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in __.20 of the final rule.  The Agencies will review the data collected and 

  54  revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.   In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by  __.20 and Appendix B.  The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entitys businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market).  In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.   On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.  All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under  __.4 through __.6(a)-(b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies,  must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to [Agency], and remediation, where appropriate.  The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.   II. Definitions The terms used in this appendix have the same meanings as set forth in  __.2 and __.3.  In addition, for purposes of this appendix, the following definitions apply: Covered trading activity means trading conducted by a trading desk under  __.4, __.5, __.6(a), or __.6(b).  A banking entity may include trading under  __.3(d), __.6(c), __.6(d) or __.6(e).     Trading desk means the smallest discrete unit of organization of a banking entity that purchases or sells financial instruments for the trading account of the banking entity or an affiliate thereof

 III. Reporting and Recordkeeping of Quantitative Measurements A. Scope of Required Reporting  General scope.  Each banking entity made subject to this part by __.20 must furnish the following quantitative measurements for each trading desk of the banking entity, calculated in accordance with this appendix:  Risk and Position Limits and Usage;  Risk Factor Sensitivities;   Value-at-Risk and Stress VaR;   Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution;   Inventory Turnover;   Inventory Aging; and  Customer-Facing Trade Ratio  B. Frequency of Required Calculation and Reporting A banking entity must calculate any applicable quantitative measurement for each trading day.  A banking entity must report each applicable quantitative measurement to [Agency] on the reporting schedule established in __.20 unless otherwise requested by [Agency].  All quantitative measurements for any calendar month must be reported within the time period required by __.20

 C. Recordkeeping A banking entity must, for any quantitative measurement furnished to [Agency] pursuant to this appendix and  __.20(d), create and maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports, as well as such information as is necessary to permit [Agency] to verify the accuracy of such reports, for a period of 5 years from the end of the calendar year for which the measurement was taken.
