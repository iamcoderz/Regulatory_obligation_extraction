  (3)      Issuing entities of asset-backed securities.  In the case of an ownership interest in an issuing entity of asset-backed securities, for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section: (i) For securitizations subject to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11), the calculations shall be made as of the date and according to the valuation methodology applicable pursuant to the requirements of section 15G of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-11) and the implementing regulations issued thereunder; or  (ii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the calculations shall be made as of the date of establishment as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this section or such earlier date on which the transferred assets have been valued for purposes of transfer to the covered fund, and thereafter only upon the date on which additional securities of the issuing entity of asset-backed securities are priced for purposes of the sales of ownership interests to unaffiliated investors.  (iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes

 (iv)  For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be 

  40  the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

 (4) Multi-tier fund investments. (i) Master-feeder fund investments. If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the feeder fund) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the master fund), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entitys permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund.  The banking entitys permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and (ii) Fund-of-funds investments.  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to __.11 of this subpart for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a fund of funds) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entitys permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the fund that is held through the fund of funds.  The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.  (c) Aggregate permitted investments in all covered funds.   (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of this subpart), on a historical cost basis.   (2) Calculation of tier 1 capital. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:  (i) Entities that are required to hold and report tier 1 capital.  If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:  (A)   In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;  

  41  (B)  In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:  (1) Bank holding company subsidiaries.  If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and (2) Other holding companies and any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards

 (iii) Treatment of foreign banking entities.    (A) Foreign banking entities.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards

 (B) U.S. affiliates of foreign banking entities.  With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  (d) Capital treatment for a permitted investment in a covered fund.  For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entitys tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of: (1) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and (2) The fair market value of the banking entitys ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.  (e) Extension of time to divest an ownership interest.   (1)   Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension
