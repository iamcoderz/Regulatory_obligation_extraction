 (b) Rules of construction. (1) Attribution of ownership interests to a covered banking entity. (i) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the amount and value of a banking entitys permitted investment in any single covered fund shall include any ownership interest held under  __.12 directly by the banking entity, including any affiliate of the banking entity

 (ii) Treatment of registered investment companies, SEC-regulated business development companies and foreign public funds.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a registered investment company, SEC-regulated business development companies or foreign public fund as described in __.10(c)(1) of this subpart will not be considered to be an affiliate of the banking entity so long as the banking entity: (A) Does not own, control, or hold with the power to vote 25 percent or more of the voting shares of the company or fund; and  (B) Provides investment advisory, commodity trading advisory, administrative, and other services to the company or fund in compliance with the limitations under applicable regulation, order, or other authority

 (iii) Covered funds.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a covered fund will not be considered to be an affiliate of a banking entity so long as the covered fund is held in compliance with the requirements of this subpart

 (iv) Treatment of employee and director investments financed by the banking entity.  For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an investment by a director or employee of a banking entity who acquires an ownership interest in his or her personal capacity in a covered fund sponsored by the banking entity will be attributed to the banking entity if the banking entity, directly or indirectly, extends financing for the purpose of enabling the director or employee to acquire the ownership interest in the fund and the financing is used to acquire such ownership interest in the covered fund

  (2)  Calculation of permitted ownership interests in a single covered fund.  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) or (4), for purposes of determining whether an investment in a single covered fund complies with the restrictions on ownership interests under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section:  

  39  (i) The aggregate number of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the total number of ownership interests held under this section by the banking entity in a covered fund divided by the total number of ownership interests held by all entities in that covered fund, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (both measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment); (ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment).  If fair market value cannot be determined, then the value shall be the historical cost basis of all investments in and contributions made by the banking entity to the covered fund;  (iii) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(2)(ii), once a valuation methodology is chosen, the banking entity must calculate the value of its investment and the investments of all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

 (iv)  For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be 

  40  the same for both the ownership interests held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards

 (4) Multi-tier fund investments. (i) Master-feeder fund investments. If the principal investment strategy of a covered fund (the feeder fund) is to invest substantially all of its assets in another single covered fund (the master fund), then for purposes of the investment limitations in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the banking entitys permitted investment in such funds shall be measured only by reference to the value of the master fund.  The banking entitys permitted investment in the master fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in the master fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the master fund that is held through the feeder fund; and (ii) Fund-of-funds investments.  If a banking entity organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to __.11 of this subpart for the purpose of investing in other covered funds (a fund of funds) and that fund of funds itself invests in another covered fund that the banking entity is permitted to own, then the banking entitys permitted investment in that other fund shall include any investment by the banking entity in that other fund, as well as the banking entitys pro-rata share of any ownership interest of the fund that is held through the fund of funds.  The investment of the banking entity may not represent more than 3 percent of the amount or value of any single covered fund.  (c) Aggregate permitted investments in all covered funds.   (1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of all ownership interests held by a banking entity shall be the sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in covered funds (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of this subpart), on a historical cost basis.   (2) Calculation of tier 1 capital. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section:  (i) Entities that are required to hold and report tier 1 capital.  If a banking entity is required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital of the banking entity as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter, as reported to its primary financial regulatory agency; and (ii) If a banking entity is not required to calculate and report tier 1 capital, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be determined to be equal to:  (A)   In the case of a banking entity that is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by such controlling depository institution in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;  

  41  (B)  In the case of a banking entity that is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a depository institution that calculates and reports tier 1 capital:  (1) Bank holding company subsidiaries.  If the banking entity is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the amount of tier 1 capital reported by the top-tier affiliate of such covered banking entity that calculates and reports tier 1 capital in the manner described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and (2) Other holding companies and any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  If the banking entity is not a subsidiary of a bank holding company or a company that is treated as a bank holding company, be equal to the total amount of shareholders equity of the top-tier affiliate within such organization as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter that has ended, as determined under applicable accounting standards

 (iii) Treatment of foreign banking entities.    (A) Foreign banking entities.  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, with respect to a banking entity that is not itself, and is not controlled directly or indirectly by, a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State, the tier 1 capital of the banking entity shall be the consolidated tier 1 capital of the entity as calculated under applicable home country standards

 (B) U.S. affiliates of foreign banking entities.  With respect to a banking entity that is located or organized under the laws of the United States or of any State and is controlled by a foreign banking entity identified under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the banking entitys tier 1 capital shall be as calculated under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section.  (d) Capital treatment for a permitted investment in a covered fund.  For purposes of calculating compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, a banking entity shall deduct from the banking entitys tier 1 capital (as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section) the greater of: (1) The sum of all amounts paid or contributed by the banking entity in connection with acquiring or retaining an ownership interest (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), on a historical cost basis, plus any earnings received; and (2) The fair market value of the banking entitys ownership interests in the covered fund as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section (together with any amounts paid by the entity (or employee thereof) in connection with obtaining a restricted profit interest under  __.10(d)(6)(ii) of subpart C), if the banking entity accounts for the profits (or losses) of the fund investment in its financial statements.  (e) Extension of time to divest an ownership interest.   (1)   Upon application by a banking entity, the Board may extend the period under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for up to 2 additional years if the Board finds that an extension 

  42  would be consistent with safety and soundness and not detrimental to the public interest.  An application for extension must: (i) Be submitted to the Board at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period; (ii) Provide the reasons for application, including information that addresses the factors in paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and (iii) Explain the banking entitys plan for reducing the permitted investment in a covered fund through redemption, sale, dilution or other methods as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section
